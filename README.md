# Photobucket-3rd-party-fix
Make images from photobucket show up again, instead of 3rd party hosting warnings

This script doesn't work anymore.

This is a userscript. If needed, install the Tampermonkey browser extension for chromium-based browsers or Greasemonkey for firefox. The script is in the .js file. Add the script to Tamper/Greasemonkey. All embedded images (img tags) hosted at photobucket (src attribute contains photobucket) will be redownloaded as if the user was on the photobucket website.
